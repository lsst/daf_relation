        `Relation.with_only_columns` is a convenience method that should
        be preferred to constructing and applying a `Projection` directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target : `Relation`
            Relation the calculation will act upon.
        preferred_engine : `Engine`, optional
            Engine that the operation would ideally be performed in.  If this
            is not equal to ``self.engine``, the ``backtrack``, ``transfer``,
            and ``require_preferred_engine`` arguments control the behavior.
        backtrack : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (default) and the current engine is not the preferred
            engine, attempt to insert this projection before a transfer
            upstream of the current relation, as long as this can be done
            without breaking up any locked relations or changing the resulting
            relation content.
        transfer : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (`False` is default) and the current engine is not the
            preferred engine, insert a new `Transfer` before the
            `Projection`.  If ``backtrack`` is also true, the transfer is
            added only if the backtrack attempt fails.
        require_preferred_engine : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (`False` is default) and the current engine is not the
            preferred engine, raise `EngineError`.  If ``backtrack`` is also
            true, the exception is only raised if the backtrack attempt fails.
            Ignored if ``transfer`` is true.
        lock : `bool`, optional
            Set `~Relation.is_locked` on the returned relation to this value.
        strip_ordering : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, remove upstream operations that impose row ordering when
            the application of this operation makes that ordering unnecessary;
            if `False` (default) raise `RowOrderError` instead (see
            `expect_unordered`).

        Returns
        -------
        relation : `Relation`
            New relation with only the given columns.  Will be ``self`` if
            ``columns == self.columns``.

        Raises
        ------
        ColumnError
            Raised if `columns` is not a subset of ``target.columns``.
        EngineError
            Raised if ``require_preferred_engine=True`` and it was impossible
            to insert this operation in the preferred engine.
        RowOrderError
            Raised if ``self`` is unnecessarily ordered; see
            `Relation.expect_unordered`.
