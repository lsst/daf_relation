        `Relation.transferred_to` is a convenience method that should

        Parameters
        ----------
        target : `Relation`
            Relation this operation will act upon.
        lock : `bool`, optional
            Set `~Relation.is_locked` on the returned relation to this value.
        strip_ordering : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, remove upstream operations that impose row ordering when
            the application of this operation makes that ordering unnecessary;
            if `False` (default) raise `RowOrderError` instead (see

        -------
        relation : `Relation`

            ``target.engine == destination``.

        Raises
        ------
        RowOrderError
            Raised if `target` is unnecessarily ordered; see
