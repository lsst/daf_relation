        """Return a new relation that applies this operation to a pair of
        existing relations.

        `Relation.chain` is a convenience method that should be preferred to
        constructing and applying a `Chain` directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lhs : `Relation`
            One relation to chain.
        rhs : `Relation`
            Other relation to chain to ``lhs``.  Must have the same columns
            and engine as ``lhs``.
        lock : `bool`, optional
            Set `~Relation.is_locked` on the returned relation to this value.
        strip_ordering : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, remove upstream operations that impose row ordering when
            the application of this operation makes that ordering unnecessary;
            if `False` (default) raise `RowOrderError` instead (see
            `Relation.expect_unordered`).

        Returns
        -------
        relation : `Relation`
            New relation with all rows from both relations.  If the engine
            `preserves order <Engine.preserves_order>` for chains, all rows
            from ``lhs`` will appear before all rows from ``rhs``, in their
            original order.  This method never returns an operand directly,
            even if the other has ``max_rows==0``, as it is assumed that even
            relations with no rows are useful to preserve in the tree for
            `diagnostics <Diagnostics>`.

        Raises
        ------
        ColumnError
            Raised if the two relations do not have the same columns.
        EngineError
            Raised if the two relations do not have the same engine.
        RowOrderError
            Raised if ``lhs`` or ``rhs`` is unnecessarily ordered; see
            `Relation.expect_unordered`.
